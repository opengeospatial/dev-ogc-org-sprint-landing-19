The main goals of this code sprint are to support the development of OGC API Tiles, Maps and Styles, as well as software which implements those standards/specifications. In addition, it also aims to create awareness about the standards/specifications and software projects. This code sprint takes place on Mundo Madou (Brussels, Belgium) and at the OGC-events Discord server. It is organised by the Open Geospatial Consortium and hosted by Eurogeographics.";
